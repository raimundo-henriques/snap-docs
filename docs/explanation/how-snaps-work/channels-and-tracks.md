# Channels and tracks

Channels are an important snap concept. They define which release of a snap is installed and tracked for updates.

The complete channel name can be structured as three distinct parts separated by slashes:

```
<track>/<risk>/<branch>
```

The _tracking_ value for an installed snap, as shown in the output from the `snap list` command, shows which channel is installed and is being followed for that snap.

To view the channel a snap is tracking, the following command may also be used:

```
snap refresh --tracking vlc
```

## Tracks

All snaps have a default track. Without the snap developer specifying otherwise, the default track is called _latest_. Similarly, when no track is specified, a snap will implicitly install from the _latest_ track. The track can also be specified explicitly:

```
snap install vlc --channel=latest/edge
```

Developers can optionally choose whether to supplement the default _latest_ track with additional tracks. The developer is also free to designate one of these as the default track to be installed when no further preference is given.

Mozilla's [Firefox snap](https://snapcraft.io/firefox) is a good example of how tracks can be used. It contains two tracks: the default _latest_ track for the majority of users, and an _esr_ track for the version of Firefox with [extended support](https://www.firefox.com/en-GB/browsers/enterprise/).

Equally, a track could also be used to track minor updates (2.0.1, 2.0.2), major updates (2.1, 2.2), or releases held for long-term support (3.2, 4.1).

Tracks are listed in the _channels_ section of the output from the `snap info` command:

```
$ snap info firefox
[...]
channels:
  latest/stable:    149.0.2-1     2026-04-08 (8107) 287MB -
  latest/candidate: 150.0-1       2026-04-16 (8172) 288MB -
  latest/beta:      150.0b10-1    2026-04-15 (8166) 288MB -
  latest/edge:      151.0a1       2026-04-17 (8175) 310MB -
  esr/stable:       140.9.1esr-1  2026-04-07 (8106) 259MB -
  esr/candidate:    140.10.0esr-1 2026-04-15 (8162) 259MB -
  esr/beta:         ↑
  esr/edge:         ↑
[...]
```

In the above output, the Firefox snap includes the custom _esr_ track. You can also see which tracks a snap supports by clicking _Other versions_ from its online Store entry.

To install Firefox from its _insider_ track, for example, use the following command:

```
snap install firefox --channel=esr/stable
```

If you already have Firefox installed, you can switch channel with the `snap refresh` command:

```
snap refresh firefox --channel=esr/stable
```

Developers must currently make a request for tracks to be added to their snap via the [#store-requests](https://forum.snapcraft.io/c/store-requests) forum category. Releases are verified and checked to ensure that reasonable user expectations are being met. For example, only _3.2.\*_ versions are accepted into a _3.2_ track.

## Risk-levels

There are four risk-levels: stable, candidate, beta and edge. These represent decreasing levels of stability for a snap, although that decision is ultimately up to the snap's publisher.

Installing from a less stable risk-level will typically mean that updates for a snap will be more frequent than for a more stable risk-level.

The risk-levels have the following meaning:

- **stable**: for the vast majority of users running on production environments.

  Releases at this risk level are as stable as they will ever get, according to the project's standards. Important software will only reach this stage once it’s ready for production use and may be used in products. There is an implied promise to avoid any changes that would disrupt those usages.

- **candidate**: for users who need to test updates prior to stable deployment, or those verifying whether a specific issue has been resolved.

  Candidate releases are considered almost ready for going into stable, but need some additional real world experimentation before they move forward. Software reaching this stage will typically have passed all available QA and review processes, since users following it expect a high stability level. Should almost never break.

- **beta**: for users wanting to test the latest features, typically outside of a production environment.

  Beta is the first level towards the stabilisation of what was before a fast moving stream of changes. Specific projects may have slightly different terminology for such releases (alpha, beta, etc) but all of these are welcome on this risk level. These releases will almost certainly have passed some sort of review and QA, but may still have unfinished parts. Breaking changes are still relatively common here.

- **edge**: for users wanting to closely track development.

  Edge releases often include a moving stream of changes without QA or review promises and are typically built automatically by a CI process from an arbitrary source code snapshot. Often the CI will only publish after some sort of automatic QA passed, and code reviews remain a good practice, but these are project specific. Assume edge releases may break often.

Snaps are installed from the stable risk-level by default. For example, the following command installs VLC from its stable channel:

```
sudo snap install vlc
```

Use the `--channel` option to select a different risk-level. The following command will install the latest beta snap of VLC:

```
sudo snap install --channel=beta vlc
```

If the beta snap is not available, a snap will be installed from the closest
channel with a more stable risk-level.

> ⓘ For brevity, `--stable`, `--candidate`, `--beta` and `--edge` can be used instead of `--channel=<risk-level>`

After installation, the risk-level being tracked can be changed with the use of the `switch` command option:

```
sudo snap switch --channel=stable vlc
```

This option will not automatically refresh the snap to force the installation
of a new snap. To switch channels and update the snap with a single command, add the `--channel` option to the _refresh_ command:

```
sudo snap refresh --channel=stable vlc
```

To check which channel a snap is tracking, look for the _tracking_ field in the output from the `snap info` command:

```
$ snap info vlc
[...]
snap-id:      RT9mcUhVsRYrDLG8qnvGiy26NKvv6Qkd
tracking:     edge
refresh-date: yesterday at 19:54 BST
[...]
```

Risk-levels may not match a project's internal conventions. Some projects may use _alpha_ instead of _edge_, for instance. However, a project's own release nomenclature should be close enough to a snap's risk-levels to allow you to judge the relative stability of the version you're installing.

## Branches

A branch is an optional, fine-grained subdivision of a channel for a published snap that allows for the creation of short-lived sequences of snaps that can be pushed on demand by snap developers to help with fixes or temporary experimentation.

Branch names convey their purpose, such as `fix-for-bug123`, but the name isn't exposed in the normal way, such as with the `snap info` command. Instead, they can only be installed by someone who knows the branch name, and this is usually only shared by the snap developer to test a specific fix or release.

After 30 days with no further updates, a branch will be closed automatically. The replacement snap will then be chosen as it would be with closed channels (see below). For example, _beta/fix-for-bug123_ will fall back to _beta_ after the _fix-for-bug123_ branch is closed.

See Snapcraft's [Manage revisions and releases](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/snapcraft/stable/how-to/publishing/manage-revisions-and-releases/) for more details on how snap developers can use branches to publish temporary snap releases.

## Closing channels

A channel can be closed by a snap publisher when there is no longer a snap that fits a channel's original purpose or specification.

For example, when a specific risk-level channel is closed, the snap store will select a snap from a more stable risk-level of the same track. If the original channel is re-opened, snaps will once again be selected from the original channel.

This approach is commonly used for beta testing. If a snap is following a _beta_ channel that is then closed, the store will offer the snap from the _candidate_ channel. If the _candidate_ channel is not available, the snap from the _stable_ channel will be selected. If the _beta_ channel re-opens, the snap will once again be selected from that channel.

In some cases, when a specific revision is given, it may appear that a snap is being installed from a less stable channel when a revision is not available on the more stable channel being tracked:

```
$ snap install hello-world --revision=28
hello-world (edge) 6.3 from Canonical✓ installed
Channel latest/stable for hello-world is closed; temporarily forwarding to edge.
```

This does not mean that the snap is now being tracked from a potentially riskier channel (_edge_, in the above example), but that the requested revision could only fetched from a riskier channel:

```
$ snapcraft list-revisions hello-world
Rev.    Uploaded              Arches    Version    Channels
29      2019-04-17T16:43:58Z  all       6.4        latest/beta*,latest/candidate*,latest/edge*,latest/stable*

```
