# Install snap on AlmaLinux OS

Snap is available for [AlmaLinux OS](https://almalinux.org/), a Linux distribution that’s being actively developed to provide binary compatibility with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and
_pre-Stream_ CentOS.

The snap packages for AlmaLinux OS can be found in the [Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL) (EPEL) repository. The EPEL repository is added to a AlmaLinux OS system with the following commands:

```
sudo dnf install epel-release
sudo dnf upgrade
```

If you use a root user rather than _sudo_ to handle security privileges, run `su` first and remove _sudo_ from subsequent commands.

## Installing snapd

With the EPEL repository added to your AlmaLinux OS installation, simply install the _snapd_ package (as root/or with _sudo_):

```
sudo dnf install snapd
```

Once installed, the _systemd_ unit that manages the main snap communication socket needs to be enabled:

```
sudo systemctl enable --now snapd.socket
```

To enable _classic_ snap support, enter the following to create a symbolic link between `/var/lib/snapd/snap` and `/snap`:

```
sudo ln -s /var/lib/snapd/snap /snap
```

Either log out and back in again or restart your system to ensure snap’s paths are updated correctly.
